    "I'll now go through this project from the beginning, highlighting my choices and how I made them. First thing was to map out generally how I would accomplish this. The below workflow illustrates the final structure I came up with, one model to generate embeddings from the text and metadata around the movie and generate a candidate items from this look up, the other to learn the user embeddings to refine these lists and offer a personalised experience. All of the data required to replicate this should be available in the correct subdirectories, but the entire project can be run from scratch by running the setup command in the make file to create and install the requirements in a virtual environment and download the data. The embeddings and collaborative filtering model can then be generated by running python *src/cf.py* and *src/nlp.py*"

    "## Improvements and considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is definitely reranking of the films, and it is clear where items like hobgoblins 2 are introduced to replace items which are previously watched by the user. However, I think that there are ways of improving this before it could be put in front of audiences or adapted to other use cases. I think there are a few clear improvements to this model, the first would be a filter on the content for children. Either a \"family friendly\" toggle, or if some percentage of the user's history is made of young audience content then don't show mature content. Both of these are impeded by the fact that there is no age rating data so the programme metadata would need to first be enriched for this content. A second improvement would be to further enrich the items with movie summaries or plot descriptions. These could then be added to the encoded strings to better refine the initial search. This could probably be done through joining to IMBD or Wiki data. This would certainly help when the titles are non-descriptive of the content or are strange non-lexical words, for example \"Jumanji\". Additionally, the length of the candidate items could be varied. When only returning the top 12 items from the SCANN index we end up with a decent list length, 8-10 for all of the users I tested after filtering and reranking. However, for a given query that list is very similar and there is only minimal reranking between users. As the list gets longer more diversity is included in the recommendations, at the very end of the list is some truly unrelated items, but I suspect it would be possible to tune the list length to have greater diversity between lists for users. Whether that behaviour is desirable or whether the nearest things to the query string should be more respected is another matter to balance. Lastly, this reranking only works for users that are present in the CF model's user embeddings. A cold start option should be added for users outside of this, or new users which would likely just be the raw return from the word embeddings query. "
